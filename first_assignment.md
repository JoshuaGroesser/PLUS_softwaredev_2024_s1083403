### A quote I like:
_"In nine hundred years of time and space and I've never met anybody who wasn't important."_

### A food or flavour I do't like:
I dislike cooked `Paprika`, however grilled, raw or roasted it tastes good...

### My recommendation:
A place in Salzburg I can recommend is taking up the steps to Kapuzinerberg and talking a walk there, as the view over the city is great.

## A useful german word:
A useful german word is _"HÃ¤?"_ which is a colloquial way of saying _"what?"_ or _"I don't understand"_
